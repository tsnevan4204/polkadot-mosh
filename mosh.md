Mosh

üåü Project Overview

Name and one-liner of the project

Mosh - A decentralized ticketing platform to help real fans access concerts fairly by verifying fan loyalty and preventing bot scalping with NFT proof.

Description

The ticketing industry is plagued by scalping and fraud: during the Taylor Swift Eras Tour, Ticketmaster crashed under 3.5 billion bot-driven requests, leaving millions of real fans locked out. In the UK, markups have reached 41% over face value, and hidden fees can climb as high as 70% of the ticket price. Mosh is a decentralized concert ticketing platform that uses blockchain technology to create a fairer experience for fans. Mosh leverages NFTs to represent ticket ownership, making each ticket scam-proof.

To combat scalping, Mosh introduces a "proof of fan-ness" system, where fans earn NFT-based loyalty badges by attending events. These badges grant early ticket access to real fans, creating a fairer and more vibrant concert atmosphere. Mosh also enforces smart contract-based resale rules: 40% of profits go to the artist, 40% to the seller, and 20% to Mosh, realigning incentives to support musicians.

By decentralizing ticketing, removing hidden fees, and fostering genuine fan engagement, Mosh addresses issues like ticket fraud, price gouging, and declining concert quality.

Polkadot Integration

Our project, Mosh, is built on Moonbeam, a Polkadot parachain, allowing us to deploy Solidity smart contracts with external dependencies from the OpenZeppelin Library. Moonbeam‚Äôs native OpenZeppelin support, efficient gas metering, 6-second block times, and low-latency finality were essential for our platform, which involves minting and transferring thousands of NFT-based tickets and loyalty badges during live ticket drops.

By building on Moonbeam, we remained fully within the Polkadot ecosystem, benefiting from the relay chain‚Äôs shared security model. Polkadot‚Äôs multichain architecture, composability, and high transaction throughput uniquely enabled us to create a decentralized ticketing platform that delivers the scalability, speed, and integrity that traditional EVM networks can't match.

In the future, we also hope to explore ink! smart contracts for development of our ticketing platform so that we can explore other parachains than Moonbeam.

Why we are excited about this project

Both of us love music and concerts, as we play instruments and DJ in our free time. We have personally felt the inconveniences of purchasing concert tickets being avid concert fans, which is why we have a personal connection to this project. We also have several connections to local artists in Philadelphia which makes us the right people to grow this platform and solve this problem by working on Mosh.

Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture to be deployed

Overview

Mosh is a decentralized concert ticketing platform built on the Moonbeam parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem. It leverages smart contract-enforced logic for NFT-based ticket issuance, resale governance, and loyalty rewards. By using Polkadot's shared security and Moonbeam's EVM compatibility, Mosh achieves secure, scalable, and fan-first ticketing.

Protocol Architecture

At its core, Mosh‚Äôs protocol is composed of three main smart contracts:

EventManager: Manages event creation, ticket drops, role registration (Fan or Musician), and attendance tracking.

Ticket: An ERC721-based NFT contract representing unique, on-chain tickets with metadata tied to each concert event.

Marketplace: Enables secure, rules-based secondary ticket sales. Resale profits are split automatically: 40% to the artist, 40% to the seller, and 20% to the Mosh protocol treasury.

Tickets are minted via createEvent calls and are traceable on-chain. Concert metadata (name, description, image) is uploaded to IPFS and linked in the NFT URI. Loyalty logic is baked into the EventManager, which tracks fan attendance and awards badges (e.g., Gold Tier) based on participation.

All contracts are deployed on Moonbeam, which offers low-latency, 6s block times, and high TPS‚Äîideal for handling thousands of mints during a ticket drop.

User Identity and Role Protocol

Upon wallet connection, users must register their role:

Fans can browse, purchase, and resell tickets. They accumulate loyalty through verified attendance.

Musicians (Event Managers) can create events, define metadata, and manage ticket distribution.

The protocol uses mappings to assign roles on-chain and prevents unauthorized actions (e.g., only musicians can create events).

NFT Resale and Incentive Logic

Mosh enforces royalty logic in secondary sales:

Resales must go through the Marketplace contract.

Smart contract splits profits: 40% to the original artist, 40% to the current seller, and 20% to the platform.

Tickets retain identity across transactions through immutable token URIs, ensuring transparency.

Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a React.js web app interacting with Moonbeam via Ethers.js. It includes:

Wallet connection and role registration UI

Event browsing and ticket buying interface

Ticket resale flow and price-setting

Dynamic dashboards for fans vs organizers

IPFS (via Pinata) is used for storing ticket images and metadata.

Components (Planned)

Planned extensions include:

Off-chain event listeners for fan engagement scoring

Mobile-first wallet abstraction and gas sponsorship

Security, Scalability, and Polkadot Integration

Built on Moonbeam, Mosh inherits:

Shared security from Polkadot‚Äôs Relay Chain

Scalable blockspace for high-volume mints

EVM compatibility for Solidity/OpenZeppelin integration

This architecture outperforms traditional EVM networks in throughput, security, and composability‚Äîenabling Mosh to operate at concert-scale in real time.

Limitations

Our product is specifically designed for concert ticketing and not events in general. By the end of the three months, we hope to have our product deployed, and while we will be promoting our platform to local musicians in the area, we have no expectations of how many artists or fans will be on our platform.
